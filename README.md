Documenting the main activities led or supported by the SIMS Remote Coordinator for the Sudan Response. 

## Activation Process

I was confirmed as the SIMS Remote Coordinator on 2023-05-05, by which point I was already supporting the SMCC processes and attending technical IM working group meetings. 

## Platform Configurations

### Slack Channel

The Slack channel is where we will coordinate on tasks that come in from the field and assign them to the relevant SIMS member. The naming convention is to use the year of the event, the iso3 code for the primary country, and the emergency type. That makes this channel: **2023_sdn_conflict** - [See the channel here](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C056G7CHP6X).

### Trello Board

Access to the Trello board can get unwieldy when too many people pile in. As a result, we've stopped letting anyone who wants to join do so, unless they are directly supporting on a task. When you create a new board, go to **Menu > More > Settings > Add/remove permissions** and toggle to **Admins** only.

I created a new board called **SIMS - Sudan Complex Emergency 2023**. The naming convention isn't as important here, but that is the general pattern I like to follow.

### Dropbox Folder

Dropbox is another process that can seem confusing to users. The key thing to keep in mind is that ownership of a folder can be migrated to others, so we aren't locking ourselves into a single user's account as the host. However, it is important to use an account that has a Business-level license, as we will inevitably use more space than is available to free tiers. 

Like Trello, we try to prevent too many people from having access to it unless they specifically need it. To do so, click on the elipsis on the far right of the folder in Dropbox's web interface, then select **Manage Permissions**

#### Manage Dropbox Access for Remote Supporters

Inside the folder for the emergency, look to the top right of the screen and click on the **Share** button. Enter the email address of each remote supporter that you're granting access. Whenever possible, always use the supporter's work email address.

#### Create Read-Only Link for SIMS Portal

Back in the top level of the folder, click on the ellipsis. The window that pops up will have a gear icon at the top right.

Click on **Link for viewing**, then leave all the settings as their default.

## Coordination

Unlike many SIMS responses, this was an operation where the SIMS Remote Coordinator did not have a deployed IM Coordinator at first. The first week was spent dealing directly with stakeholders in the field in order to either directly triage their requests, or intuit based on conversations what products should be proactively produced before being formally requested. There will be an IM Coordinator deploying the week of May 15, and when they arrive, the coordination process will revert back to standard practice where the IM Co manages the process of identifying the requests and communicating them to the SIMS Co, who in turn facilitates the tasking out to the network.

### Working Groups

We have set up a joint IM Technical Working Group with the ICRC to facilitate the sharing of resources and ensure we aren't duplicating each others' efforts. This group is currently meeting twice a week, but the cadence will likely increase as the operation staffs up.

## Tasking

There is an operations manager for Sudan that is currently based in Nairobi, but is planning on traveling to Sudan at some point soon once security issues are fully analyzed. He has been our main focal point and the person requesting these products.

## Lessons and Innovations

- **Support Profiles**: This was the first time we tried to align and categorize requests directly with the support profiles: geospatial, web visualization, information design, data transformation and analysis, and data collection and survey design. Having tasks organized (and correspondingly tagged in Trello) helps focus people's attention by the sort of specializations they possess.
